Here is my second project, which aims to calculate e to the power of x using the Taylor series. I learned that to calculate approximations of this kind it is more useful to find a reference formula to use. Thus, from that factorial I managed to reach trivial multiplications that will not clutter the processor. I added a function that when typing a character, in my case 'N' and 'n' the program will either end or continue. What did I learn? -to use repetitive structures such as for, do while and while; -to use in an intelligent way the way to calculate an approximation like this without cluttering the processor with unnecessary calculations
